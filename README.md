# lsea

`lsea` is an R package for perfoming Lipid Structure Enrichment Analysis (LSEA) on combinations of lipid classes, chain lengths, and degrees of unsaturation. Lipid sets for testing are assembled from the lipid species provided based on their LIPIDMAPS-style name. Lipid species name parsing is designed for results generated by the UCLA lipidomics lab.
