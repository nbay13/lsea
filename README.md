`lsea` is an R package for perfoming Lipid Structure Enrichment Analysis (LSEA) on combinations of lipid classes, chain lengths, and degrees of unsaturation.

Lipid sets for testing are assembled from the lipid species provided based on their LIPIDMAPS-style name. Name parsing is designed for results generated by the UCLA lipidomics lab.  

## Dependencies
[compositions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/compositions/index.html) <br />
[fgsea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html)

## Installation
```R
if(!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("nbay13/lsea")
```
## Usage
See vignette using example data to perform differential composition testing and LSEA
NOTE: Vignette still being updated after recent changes to LSEA lipid species annotation and enrichment analysis!!
